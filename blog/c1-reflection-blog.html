    <h1 class="pagetitle">My initial reflections entering DevAcademy</h1>
        
    <h2 class="subheading">
      What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?
    </h2>
    <p class="bodytext">
      It has a strong emphasis on the collaborative approach to learning. Acknowledging that everyone has a valuable contribution 
      to make and that learning can be much faster when you take full ownership of your own learning experience as well as using the opportunity
      to teach others in order to solidify knowledge and discover new areas for improvement.
    </p>
    <p class="bodytext">
      Another aspect that is heavily emphasised is equipping people with the ability to be self aware of their own approach to learning and interacting
      with others, as well as building the habit of spending time reflecting on what you are doing and how it is affecting others.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="subheading">
      How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
    </h2>
    <p class="bodytext">
      I hope that my passion for the field will inspire me to extend myself and completely commit myself to the learning process.
      I think I will have to be conscious in the phase 0 stage of making sure I can attend the check ins wherever possible as I can see this
      being a difficulty alongside continuing work though I also see how it could be very valuable.
    </P>

    <h2 class="subheading">
      Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
    </h2>
    <p class="bodytext">
      My idea of how the phase 0 stage of the program might go has changed. I can see it will be very important even in this early stage to focus
      on the co-operative learning environment with the cohort, for my benefit and theirs.
    </p>

    <h2 class="subheading">
      Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
    </h2>
    <p class="bodytext">
      I find the idea of self directed/motivated learning empowering and deeply satisfying. My first impressions of the process of learning programming
      and the development community are that knowledge is much more freely available and shared than in other fields. Without this gate keeping the
      opportunity to go a long way quickly does seem believable and this excites me.
    </p>
