          <h4>Process over product</h4>
          <p>
            I think I engaged with this sprint in a way that allowed me to effectively tackle some concepts that were
            entirely new to me without getting too concerned with gaining complete mastery of them. Instead I tried to
            get a good enough understanding of the UI design concepts I was being taught to begin my own redesign and
            looked for additional resources when I thought it would help.
            <br><br>
            Being reminded of this concept also helped when I ran into problems with how my site was presenting on
            mobile devices. I discovered that my site would appear one way when shown in a browser at a mobile width
            but would appear differently when I actually viewed it on a mobile device. Instead of being focused on how
            my site looked and what I might do to improve it, I referred back to what I had been taught about the browser
            developer tools, the DOM & CSS structure. Using those I was able to see that styling appeared to be applied
            correctly to my site and eventually discovered that I was simply missing a meta tag in the header of my site
            to specify how it would be rendered on mobile devices. This whole process was a great learning experience
            and I feel like I have a much better understanding of CSS having gone through it.

          <h4>Reflections on "Search Inside Yourself", chapter 2</h4>
          <p>
            Before reading this chapter of the book I had thought meditation was a very useful but also very enjoyable
            exercise to engage with. I had found it to be a really great way to regulate stress and negative emotions
            but I hadn't really thought of it as having produced positivity in and of itself. Reading the evidence
            presented in the book to back this up was really encouraging and made me determined to make meditation
            an even greater priority in my life. The suggestion that meditation can also have lasting physical effects
            on your body is also fascinating, it reminded me of some other articles I've read on the enteric nervous
            system and shows how surprising the connections between the brain and the body can be.
