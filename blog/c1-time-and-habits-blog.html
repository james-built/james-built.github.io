    <h1 class="pagetitle">My reflections on time and habit techniques</h1>

        <h2 class="subheading">Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">I continued to use a practice of mindful meditation I have been working on
           to clear my thoughts and energise myself each time before working on the sprint.
           I also experimented with the Pomodoro technique and can see great promise in this,
           particularly when it comes to budgeting my time for future tasks. Also I found a
           psychological reward in seeing an increase in productivity within the timed units.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">What worked for you and what will you experiment with further?</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">I have found mindfulness is very effective for me and can be a helpful trigger for
           achieving a state of flow. I'll continue to work with the pomodoro technique
           as well as strictly timeboxing my tasks since falling down a rabbit hole of research
           is a particular weakness I see that I need to address.</p>
